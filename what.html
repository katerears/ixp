      <h1>What do I need to do?</h1>
      <p class="intro-text">When it's your directorate's turn, your Administrative Officer will reach out to each employee in order of seniority.</p>
      <p class="intro-text">This includes <strong>GS level</strong>, which determines what type of workspace you are eligible for, and <strong>years of service</strong>, which determines the order in which you get to select a workspace.</p>
      <h2>Who goes first and why?</h2>
      <p class="intro-text">Within each grade level, <strong>employees with a higher number of years of NSF tenure get to choose first</strong>, with an exception for a supervisory role vs. a non-supervisory role at the same grade.</p>
